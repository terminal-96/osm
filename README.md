Open Social Media Platform

### Goal:

An ad-free, open source alternative to current social media platforms -- no advertising, you can host it yourself, and is group focused.  There should be a central deployment that people can used with a small monthly fee or donation.

Each user can be part of multiple communities.  These communities can represent families, clubs, churches, or anything else.  Users can create a community for a monthly fee.

There should be no tracking in this application to help prevent any isolation tanks.  

I'd like the back-end to be NodeJS and the Front End to be VueJS and native mobile apps.

GPL-3 License to ensure that derivatives publicly provide their source code.
